# CdsCTF

> "The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do." - Steve Jobs

## Repository Structure

CdsCTF project is divided into several GitHub repositories.

### Backend

- [ElaBosak233/cdsctf](https://github.com/ElaBosak233/cdsctf): The core repository.

### Frontend

- [cdsctf/cdsant](https://github.com/cdsctf/cdsant): A temporary frontend implementation of CdsCTF. (recommended)
- [cdsctf/cdsuno](https://github.com/cdsctf/cdsuno): Independent implementation of CdsCTF frontend without relying on UI libraries.

> Q: Is there any confirmed frontend implementation that CdsCTF will support in the long term?
> 
> Temporarily no. The founders of CdsCTF have always wanted a frontend with elegant design, but due to personal limitations, the self implemented frontend was not very ideal. So the future frontend is a choice between continuing self implementation and using a stable Material you design.

### Documentation

- [cdsctf/docs](https://github.com/cdsctf/docs): Official documentation in multiple languages. Recorded detailed feature introductions and deployment guidance.
